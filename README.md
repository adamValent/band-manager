They can set for the band the musical style (e.g., rock, pop, etc.), a name, and a logo. Band managers can add new albums and songs to a band. Each Song has a name and a duration. Managers can also schedule tours for the bands regarding dates and cities visited. Team members can log in to the system and see the offers made by the band managers.
